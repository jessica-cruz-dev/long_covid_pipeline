# long_covid_pipeline

- Object oriented implementation of the long covid pipeline
- Class and class constants defined in run/ folder  

Updated the python part of the codebase to be object-oriented, pep8 compliant, and seperated out the parallelizing code to improve readability.

This repo is a subset of the IHME nonfatal COVID pipeline, specifically just the "launcher" scripts with internal filepaths redacted.
