# long_covid_pipeline

## Object oriented implementation of the long covid pipeline 

At IHME, I've had the opportunity to work on multiple teams as a Surge Data Specialist. One of these was the Nonfatal and Risk Factors Quality Enhancements team where I was tasked with updating the pipeline to be compatible with our new SLURM HPC cluster plus running and debugging the pipeline on new data for paper production. 

During this time, I updated the pipeline to be object-oriented, pep8 compliant, and seperated out the parallelizing code to improve readability.

This repo is a subset of the IHME nonfatal COVID pipeline, specifically just the "launcher" scripts with internal filepaths redacted.
